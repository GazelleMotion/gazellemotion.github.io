              Software Engineer and Designer that enjoys building great
              Products from end to end.
            </p>
            <p>
              I&apos;m always curious about Art, Science, and People. Personally,
              I believe everything in the universe is connected to everything else. 
              Over time I&apos;ve worked on various projects involving Backend Services and UI Design.
              Most people believe Art and Science are separate fields,
              which is academically correct, but personally,
              I believe Art & Science have no reason to be disconnected and that&apos;s exactly
              how I view the world and approach life. 
            </p>
            <p>
              I mostly code using C# but also work with
              other Tools like ASP.NET Core, SQL, Entity Framework Core, WPF, JavaScript/TypeScript, HTML,
              CSS, React.js/Next.js.
            </p>
            <p>
              Outside work, you might find me cheering my favorite sports team. 
              I&apos;m into Soccer and Formula One Racing at the moment. 
              A Huge fan of Sports teams like SC Vipers, Manchester United, and Mercedes F1.
            </p>
