## The Challenge

Creating a free Windows Optimization solution that automatically runs in the background of a user's Windows Operating System Device to routinely clean up Junk files, save storage/space and improve performance, without the user having to do it manually every time. Junk files are temporary files that were created so that your computer/device could perform a task, such as opening a document, viewing an image, or browsing the internet. As professionals, we often find ourselves spending valuable time managing the performance of our Windows devices, specifically dealing with system junk files that can clog up our devices and cause poor performance. There's other alternatives out there but many of which are not even free on top of hogging your system resources. As professionals, while working with our Windows device, we want to spend our most valuable time working on more critical problems instead. Resultantly, making us more productive.

## The Concept

Work on a native Windows Desktop application that runs automatically in the background of a Windows device without hogging up too much system resources. In this scenario, performance was paramount. To work on a solution that addressed these issues, we needed to choose tools and technologies that worked really well at helping us get the job done, technologies with a wide community and support behind them, tools that enabled us build performant native desktop applicaitons for Windows. For our scenario, C# & .NET ticked all these boxes. In addition to all that, the Windows SDK developed by the .NET team gave us access to more possibilities.
