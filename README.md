### Overview

This repository powers my [Official Website](https://ronnielutalo.github.io). This is where I share all my thoughts and learnings on Driving Digital Transformation & Venture Building | Redefining African Storytelling | Extended Reality, Blockchain, NFTs, Open Source.

I leverage over 5 years of experience across driving digital transformation and venture building in Africa to empower creators, founders, organizations, and businesses. My mission is to foster innovation, develop scalable solutions, and redefine African storytelling.

At [StartHub Africa](https://starthubafrica.org/), I work on building a sustainable pipeline of investable technology startups. I work alongside early-stage founders, helping them transform innovative ideas into scalable technology products, secure their first customers, and generate revenue. I’ve mentored more than 50 founders, guiding them through product development, ensuring their ventures are both innovative and market-ready.

Previously, I worked as a Software Engineer on innovative projects for leading technology companies like [Andela](https://www.andela.com/) and startups such as [Agri-Logistics Uganda](https://www.agri-logistics.org/), where I led product design and development for web platforms and mobile applications. This hands-on experience has equipped me with the ability to build products that solve real-world problems.

I’m skilled at digital tools & programming languages such as C#, ASP.NET Core, React.js, JavaScript, and Adobe XD, and I use these tools to bring both innovative tech solutions and creative projects to life.

**Note:** An exciting journey of transformation is underway as I work on a significant re-design for the website, aimed at elevating the User Experience and beyond. During this process, you might notice some deviations from the expected behavior and the possibility of encountering minor regressions. I invite you to anticipate the upcoming release, where these improvements will take center stage.
