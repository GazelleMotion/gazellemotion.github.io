### Overview

This repository powers the [Official Website](https://ronnielutalo.github.io) for Ronnie Lutalo. Software Engineer, Filmmaker, Open Source Advocate. This is where I write all my Thoughts on software, building products, filmmaking, leadership, travelling, and other random stuff. Not structured.

With over 5+ years of experience in the technology industry, I've worked extensively on different products with various product teams across East Africa as a Software Engineer at companies such as Andela, served as a Technical Lead at Open-Source Community Africa - Kampala, driving collaborative projects and community initiatives. Additionally, worked as a Consultant with the United Nations (UN Women) to implement the second phase of the African Girls Can Code Initiative (AGCCI) in Uganda.

To delve into the breadth of my work, feel free to explore my diverse [portfolio](https://ronnielutalo.github.io/portfolio).

**Note:** An exciting journey of transformation is underway as I work on a significant re-design for the website, aimed at elevating the User Experience and beyond. During this process, you might notice some deviations from the expected behavior and the possibility of encountering minor regressions. I invite you to anticipate the upcoming release, where these improvements will take center stage.
