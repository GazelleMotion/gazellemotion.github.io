## Official Personal Website

### Overview

This is the code that powers my [Official Personal Website](https://ronnielutalo.github.io/blog/) where I get to [write](https://ronnielutalo.github.io/blog/) about new stuff I'm working on while sharing my lessons along the way.

**Note:** Currently working on a major re-design for the entire website to improve the User Experience for everyone ultimately. During this process, the website may not behave as expected and a lot of regressions maybe experienced. Keep an eye on the next release.
