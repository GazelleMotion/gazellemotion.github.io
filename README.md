## Official Personal Website
### Overview

This is the code that powers my [Official Personal Website](https://ronnielutalo.github.io/blog/). This site is where I get to write [articles](https://ronnielutalo.github.io/blog/) about stuff I'm working on while sharing my lessons along the way. I also write about my [Personal Projects](https://ronnielutalo.github.io/projects/), Product Development, Software Engineering and Computer Graphics. Most of them are solutions I created to solve a particular problem I was personally facing.
