### Overview

This is the code that powers my [Official Personal Portfolio Website](https://ronnielutalo.github.io) showcasing my work in Computer Graphics focusing on Rendering & Simulation for Virtual Reality and Visual Effects for film & television, while sharing thoughts, actionable tips and insights. Aside from my work in Computer Graphics, I work on projects involving Web Development, Product Design and Windows Development. My portfolio showcases a proven track record of success in delivering compelling products and experiences that are highly optimized for performance.

**Note:** Currently working on a major re-productDesign for the Website to improve the User Experience and more. During this process, the website may not behave as expected and you may experience some regressions. Keep an eye on the next release.
