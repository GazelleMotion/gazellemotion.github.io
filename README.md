### Overview

This repository powers my [Official Personal Website](https://ronnielutalo.github.io), a dynamic platform that showcases my work in a quest to create the future of Innovation, Filmmaking, and Adventure (Tourism). The kind of future that I want to see. I also write about my journey and most of the lessons learnt along the way. To delve into the breadth of my work, feel free to explore my diverse [portfolio](https://ronnielutalo.github.io/portfolio).

**Note:** An exciting journey of transformation is underway as I work on a significant re-design for the website, aimed at elevating the User Experience and beyond. During this process, you might notice some deviations from the expected behavior and the possibility of encountering minor regressions. I invite you to anticipate the upcoming release, where these improvements will take center stage.
