## Official Personal Website

[![CI](https://github.com/RonnieLutalo/ronnielutalo.github.io/actions/workflows/CI.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/RonnieLutalo/ronnielutalo.github.io/actions/workflows/CI.yml)

### Overview

This is the code that powers my [Official Personal Website](https://ronnielutalo.github.io/blog/) where I get to [write](https://ronnielutalo.github.io/blog/) new stuff I'm working on while sharing my lessons along the way.

**Note:** Currently working on a major re-design for the entire website to improve the User Experience for everyone ultimately. During this process, the website may not behave as expected and a lot of regressions maybe experienced. Keep an eye on the next release.
