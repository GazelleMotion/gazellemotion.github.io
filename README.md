## Official Personal Website

[![CI](https://github.com/RonnieLutalo/ronnielutalo.github.io/actions/workflows/CI.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/RonnieLutalo/ronnielutalo.github.io/actions/workflows/CI.yml)

### Overview

This is the code that powers my [Official Personal Website](https://ronnielutalo.github.io/blog/). This site is where I get to write [articles](https://ronnielutalo.github.io/blog/) about stuff I'm working on while sharing my lessons along the way. I also write about [Personal Projects](https://ronnielutalo.github.io/projects/), Product Development, Software Engineering and Computer Graphics.

**Note:** Currently working on a major re-design for the entire website. Keep an eye on the next release.
