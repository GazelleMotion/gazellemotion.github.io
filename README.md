## Official Gazelle Motion Website

### Overview

This repository powers the [Official Website](https://gazellemotion.github.io) for Gazelle Motion, a cutting-edge media production company on a mission to redefine African Storytelling.. To delve into the breadth of my work, feel free to explore our diverse [portfolio](https://gazellemotion.github.io/portfolio).

**Note:** An exciting journey of transformation is underway as I work on a significant re-design for the website, aimed at elevating the User Experience and beyond. During this process, you might notice some deviations from the expected behavior and the possibility of encountering minor regressions. I invite you to anticipate the upcoming release, where these improvements will take center stage.
