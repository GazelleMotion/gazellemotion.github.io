## Official Personal Website

### Overview

This repository powers my [Official Personal Website](https://ronnielutalo.github.io), a dynamic platform that showcases my journey through the realms of Computer Graphics, Engineering, Community Management, and Filmmaking. This site is a window into my world, where I share both the outcomes of my endeavors and the knowledge I've gained along the way. To delve into the breadth of my work, feel free to explore my diverse [portfolio](https://ronnielutalo.github.io/portfolio).

**Note:** Currently I'm working on a major re-Design for the Website to improve the User Experience and more. During this process, the website may not behave as expected and you may experience some regressions. Keep an eye on the next release.
