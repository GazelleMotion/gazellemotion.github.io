## Official Personal Website

[![Deploy Next.js site to Pages](https://github.com/RonnieLutalo/ronnielutalo.github.io/actions/workflows/nextjs-deployment.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/RonnieLutalo/ronnielutalo.github.io/actions/workflows/nextjs-deployment.yaml)

### Overview

This is the code that powers my [Official Personal Website](https://ronnielutalo.github.io) where I share my thoughts and [write](https://ronnielutalo.github.io/blog) about Software Engineering, Windows Development, Product Development, Web Development, Visual Arts and more.

**Note:** Currently working on a major re-design for the Website to improve the User Experience and more. During this process, the website may not behave as expected and you may experience some regressions. Keep an eye on the next release.
