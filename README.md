## Official Personal Website

[![Deploy Next.js site to Pages](https://github.com/RonnieLutalo/ronnielutalo.github.io/actions/workflows/nextjs-deployment.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/RonnieLutalo/ronnielutalo.github.io/actions/workflows/nextjs-deployment.yaml)

### Overview

This is the code that powers my [Official Personal Website](https://ronnielutalo.github.io) where I [write](https://ronnielutalo.github.io/blog) about software engineering, animation techniques, design systems and more. I also talk about new and recent [stuff I'm working on](https://ronnielutalo.github.io/work) while sharing lessons learnt along the way.

**Note:** Currently working on a major re-design for the entire website to improve the User Experience for everyone ultimately. During this process, the website may not behave as expected and a lot of regressions maybe experienced. Keep an eye on the next release.
