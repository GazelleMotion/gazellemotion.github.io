export const aboutMe = `
My name is Ronnie Lutalo, a Software Engineer from Kampala, Uganda. 
Mostly focusing on Rendering and Simulation Technology for Virtual Reality and Visual Effects for Film & Television.
As child, I was always captivated by the world of art and spent countless hours drawing and exploring 
different techniques. My passion for visual arts only grew stronger during my high school days as 
I delved deeper into the work of great artists and engineers like Michelangelo and Leonardo Da Vinci. 
I often spent countless hours reading about these Renaissance masters in the school library and experimenting 
with my own art pieces while studying the techniques of the old masters.

My love for technology was also sparked at a young age. 
My father introduced me to computers during my school vacation and I quickly became 
enamored with the endless possibilities that technology offered. I went on to pursue a 
degree in Science in Information Technology at university and it was there that 
my journey with technology truly took shape. I now combine my passion for art and technology 
to create unique and compelling products and experiences. I've basically been Rendering stuff 
since I was a kid, it's just now a difference in the mediums that when I first started out,
I was rendering stuff on paper but now do digital experiences with a bit more Technology. 

I’ve worked with startups, corporate organizations and established businesses 
for the past 5 years and I've acquired a deep understanding of the ever-changing technology 
landscape and challenging markets. 
I have experience working with a variety of technologies, including C#, Unity 3D,
Autodesk Maya, Adobe Suit. 
My portfolio showcases a proven track record of success in delivering products and
experiences that are compelling and highly optimized for performance.

I take a fresh approach to every project I work on and strive for excellence in all that I do.
I collaborate effectively to nurture and transform ideas into finished products. 
To ensure a smooth working experience, I’m constantly trying
improve my self at Communication and Project Management.

Outside work, you might find me cheering for my favorite sports team. I'm into sports like Soccer 
and Formula One racing at the moment and I'm a huge fan of teams like SC Vipers, Manchester United
and Mercedes F1 Racing.
