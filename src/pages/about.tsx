                  Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Ronnie Lutalo, a Software Engineer with both
                  Software Development and Project Management experience as an
                  Individual Contributor and as a Leader respectively. Over
                  time, I've worked on various projects involving Web
                  Development and Windows Development using C#, ASP.NET Core,
                  SQL, Entity Framework Core, WPF, JavaScript/TypeScript, HTML,
                  CSS, React.js/Next.js. Aside from my engineering work, I
                  occasionally work on projects involving Visual Art & Design.
                </p>
                <p data-fade='4'>
                  I also work as a Consultant with United Nations Women
                  alongside other experienced professionals to share Technical
                  knowledge, experience and Mentorship for the African Girls Can
                  Code Initiative (AGCCI) aimed at empowering young girls across
                  Africa to become computer programmers, creators and designers.
                  As an Open Source Technology Enthusiast, I engage both as a
                  Contributor & Technical Lead at Open Source Community Africa
                  (OSCA) - Kampala where we are changing the narrative from
                  having Ugandans not only as users of technology but also as
                  contributors.
                </p>
                <p data-fade='5'>
